Repository for Jose Ignacio Villanueva Rojas Exercise to Marc Wilson

I installed OpenJMS into my local machine.
I added all .jar files from the server to my Eclipse project.
No more external jars needed.
Started the server up.
Launched testing classes and local console will display the logs for sender and receiver testing classes.

Thnaks in advance!!
